# r-data-workflows
My collection of reusable R code for Data Analysis

Hi!

This repository contains a personal collection of reusable R functions and script templates created while learning R.

The goal of this project is to:
- Store common data cleaning, analysis, and plotting code
- Write reusable functions that work across different datasets
- Reduce repetitive work by reusing tested code
- Serve as a reference for future projects and professional work

If you find anything useful then feel free to use it, I hope it helps you as much as it helped me! :)

## Structure
- `functions/` – Reusable R functions (cleaning, summaries, helpers)
- `scripts/` – Template analysis scripts that can be adapted to new datasets
- `utils/` – Utility scripts (e.g., package loading)
- `data/` – Small example datasets for testing

## Notes
- Code is written to be dataset-agnostic where possible
- Functions use parameters instead of hard-coded values
- This repository evolves as my R skills improve
